# Smart Core Conductor (for now)

This ui allows you to setup and manage smart core nodes (area controllers, app servers, edge gateways, etc). This is the
default ui you get when you visit any of these boxes IPs.

It's located here in the project because we don't yet know how much of it will be 'Smart Core' and how much will be
'Project', so best to be specific and pull out the commonality when we actually have proof it'll be needed.

## Getting started

Run the UI in dev mode (hot reloading, etc) with `yarn run dev` - assuming you have run `yarn install` and have the
dependencies ready.
