OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant
===============================

The Client Credentials Grant is used to issue an access token to a client operating on its own behalf,
i.e. not on behalf of a user. The client proves its identity to the Auth Server by presenting its
Client Secret, which has been preregistered.
